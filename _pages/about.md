<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a final-year undergraduate student pursuing a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science and Engineering at the **University of Dhaka**, Bangladesh, with a CGPA of **3.83/4.00**. My research interests lie at the intersection of **high-performance machine learning systems**, **distributed computing**, and **natural language processing**, with applications in large-scale scientific data analysis. I am particularly focused on developing scalable neural architectures for high-throughput data processing, parallel computing, and real-time inference systems.

Currently, I am working as a **Research Assistant** under the supervision of **Dr. Muhammad Ibrahim** at the University of Dhaka, where I am developing large-scale Bangla QA datasets and fine-tuning transformer-based models for question answering systems. I am also an active member of the **DU_Caffeine Team**, where I have contributed to winning multiple national hackathons through the development and deployment of ML solutions.

I am passionate about building efficient, scalable systems that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world applications. My work spans computer vision, NLP, time-series forecasting, and high-performance computing with MPI and OpenMP.
